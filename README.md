This repository contains the code and methodologies used in my research on the impact of transportation infrastructure on real estate prices. The study employs econometric modeling and causal inference techniques, including difference-in-differences (DID), propensity score matching (PSM), and spatial econometrics, to quantify how new transportation projects influence housing prices and rents.

The analysis is based on real estate transaction data and GIS-based spatial data, integrating methods from urban economics, statistical modeling, and machine learning to derive robust conclusions. The repository includes data preprocessing scripts, model implementations, and visualization tools to support policy recommendations for sustainable urban development.

Key mathematical and analytical techniques applied:

Econometrics: DID, PSM, panel data regression
Statistical modeling: Generalized linear models, hypothesis testing
Geospatial analysis: Spatial interpolation, buffer zone analysis
Machine learning: Feature engineering, predictive modeling for price estimation, Principal Component Analysis
This work contributes to understanding how infrastructure investments shape real estate markets and urban development dynamics.
